Like always, start with nmap. I use my own tool to automate nmap scan, check it out [pymap](https://github.com/bibo318/pymap)
```console
$ python3 pymap.py -t $IP 
```
There are 2 open ports:
- 22/tcp open  ssh
- 80/tcp open  http

If web is up, I alway start with running `gobuster` to brute forcing web directory. While `gobuster` is running, I explore the web or walking the "happy path" by using the web in the way it was meant to be used by a normal user.

## rabbit hole + user credential
I start by checking the source code and I found this:
`<!--(Check console for extra surprise!)-->`. ofc I open dev-tool and check what is in the console. I found the array with then pokemon name...
```js
[
  "Bulbasaur",
  "Charmander",
  "Squirtle",
  "Snorlax",
  "Zapdos",
  "Mew",
  "Charizard",
  "Grimer",
  "Metapod",
  "Magikarp"
]
```
more over I found this js script.
```js
<script type="text/javascript">
    const randomPokemon = [
        'Bulbasaur', 'Charmander', 'Squirtle',
        'Snorlax',
        'Zapdos',
        'Mew',
        'Charizard',
        'Grimer',
        'Metapod',
        'Magikarp'
    ];
    const original = randomPokemon.sort((pokemonName) => {
        const [aLast] = pokemonName.split(', ');
    });

    console.log(original);
</script>
```
I try to understand it but it seem like it lead me nowhere... So I go back to the source and check it again in case I missed something.


Yep I missed not just something. There is username:password hidden somewhere close to `<!--(Check console for extra surprise!)-->`. But I was so focus on check console log message.......

# foot hold
now that we have user credential. Lets ssh to the victim server and enumerate the server a bit.

```console
pokemon@root:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for pokemon: 
Sorry, user pokemon may not run sudo on root.
pokemon@root:~$ id
uid=1000(pokemon) gid=1000(pokemon) groups=1000(pokemon),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),113(lpadmin),128(sambashare)
 4096 Jun 24 13:48 ..
drwx------  6 root    root    4096 Jun 24 14:14 ash
drwxr-xr-x 18 pokemon pokemon 4096 Aug 10 09:53 pokemon
-rwx------  1 ash     root       8 Jun 22 23:21 roots-pokemon.txt
```
so as you can see, the current user is not allow to run sudo. Moreover, there are 2 users in this server. the current user and `ash`. I assume that `ash` is a root user since he is main guy in pokemon :P. 

now let enumerate more. and I end up find a `.zip` file in `Desktop`. Unzip and u will find our fist flag!!
```console
pokemon@root:~$ cd Desktop/
pokemon@root:~/Desktop$ ls
P0kEmOn.zip
pokemon@root:~/Desktop$ unzip P0kEmOn.zip 
Archive:  P0kEmOn.zip
   creating: P0kEmOn/
  inflating: P0kEmOn/grass-type.txt  
pokemon@root:~/Desktop$ ls
P0kEmOn  P0kEmOn.zip
pokemon@root:~/Desktop$ cd P0kEmOn/
pokemon@root:~/Desktop/P0kEmOn$ ls
grass-type.txt
pokemon@root:~/Desktop/P0kEmOn$ cat grass-type.txt 
50 __ __ __ __ __ __
```
the flag is encoded, decode it and submit the flag!


At this point we know the format of the flag. We can craft a simple regex to and using `find` to look for more flags. The name of the 1st flag call `grass-type.txt`. So I assume that the flag should looks something likt `pokemontype-type.txt`. Where *pokemontype* can be grass, frie, water, electric, etc. The regex will be `*-type.txt`


now let run find command
```console
pokemon@root:~$ find / -user pokemon -name *type.txt 2> /dev/null 
/var/www/html/water-type.txt
/home/pokemon/Desktop/P0kEmOn/grass-type.txt
```
Bingo ! grab the flag! note that the flag is encoded (agian). Decoded and submit the flag

The current user home directory is huge. There are many sub directory and such. let enumerate all of them at ones with `pokemon@root:~$ ls -la *`. you will find a really interesting directory. Dig deeper and you will find a file call `Could__________for?.cplusplus`

```console
pokemon@root:~/__________$ cat Could__________for?.cplusplus
# include <iostream>

int main() {
	std::cout << "ash : <something_here>"
	return 0;
}
```

We found a `ash` credential which I gussed that he is a root user. now let log into `ash`

# root
there is many way to log into as `ash`. You can `ssh` as `ash` or use `su`. In this case, I will use `su`:
```console
pokemon@root:~$ su ash
Password: 
To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

bash: /home/ash/.bashrc: Permission denied
ash@root:/home/pokemon$
```
yea let grab the `roots-pokemon.txt`.
```console
ash@root: cat /home/roots-pokemon.txt
```
we still have need to find the 3rd flag. Since we already have the regex for finding the flag, let re-use it again!!
```console
ash@root:/$ find / -user ash -name *type.txt 2> /dev/null 
ash@root:/$ find / -user root -name *type.txt 2> /dev/null 
/____/________/fire-type.txt
```
Grab the flag and decode it
