since we included ```-ep bypass```. we will be able to execute ```PowerView``` 
```ps
PS C:\Users\Administrator> . .\Downloads\PowerV
iew.ps1
```
now let enumerate the domain using ```Get-NetUser```
```ps
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-NetUser | select cn # getting all users

cn                  
--                          
Administrator

sshd
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-NetGroup -GroupName *admin*  # Enumerate the domain groups with admin as regex
