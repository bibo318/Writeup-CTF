back to /dinnerRoom/ I put gold emblem flag and got this

back to secret room in bar room. i put emblem and got a username ? `rebecca`

after thinking back and forward, we have a cipher and we got a username? From the look of cipher it is a subtitution cipher. Then it kicks me, `rebecca` might be a password of a cipher (Vigenere). decode it to get a

Jill,

I think the helmet key is inside the text file, but I have no clue on decrypting stuff. Also, I come across a /hidden_closet/ door but it was locked.

From,
Barry

so new clue.. `/hidden_closet/`

back to `/studyRoom/` put `helmet_key`. download the .tar and extract it. you will get SSH username 
`SSH user: umbrella_guest`

in `/hidden_closet/` you will find `wolf_medal.txt` which contain ssh password 
```
SSH password: T_virus_rules
```
also you will find a cipher again. I guess it is encoded with Vigenere, again.. let ssh to victim server and find the key to the cipher.

Chris: Jill, you finally come. I was locked in the Jail cell for a while. It seem that weasker is behind all this.
Jil, What? Weasker? He is the traitor?
Chris: Yes, Jill. Unfortunately, he play us like a damn fiddle.
Jill: Let's get out of here first, I have contact brad for helicopter support.
Chris: Thanks Jill, here, take this MO Disk 2 with you. It look like the key to decipher something.
Jill: Alright, I will deal with him later.
Chris: see ya.

MO disk 2: albert 
```

albert is the key to the cipher we fond at `/hidden_closet/`. now decipher it.

In the state of emergency, Jill, Barry and Chris are reaching the helipad and awaiting for the helicopter support.

Suddenly, the Tyrant jump out from nowhere. After a tough fight, brad, throw a rocket launcher on the helipad. Without thinking twice, Jill pick up the launcher and fire at the Tyrant.

The Tyrant shredded into pieces and the Mansion was blowed. The survivor able to escape with the helicopter and prepare for their next fight.
