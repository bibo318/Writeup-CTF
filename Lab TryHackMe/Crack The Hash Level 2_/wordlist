no you wont
but if i can't have you
to go over everything
is on your case
is going to go away
you say it's all in my head
if this is ain't love then what is
sweetest
we're willing to take the risk
the reason you loved me before
'cause i knew that that was
but when the pain cuts you deep
without falling to your feet
all the things you'd say
look up to the sky not just the floor
hello from the other side
it blew me away
everybody loves the things you do
turning tables yeah
no i wont rescue you to just desert me
you still look like a movie
wait do you see my heart on my sleeve
never mind said your open arms
means we can break every law
are the wonders of my world
go to the ends of the earth for you
they say that time's supposed to heal ya
that we might be exactly like we were
have i ever asked for much
you've been on my mind
no there's nothing
and pull me to the light
i've cried my heart out
he lends his coat for shelter
feeling up his girl
nobody told me that youd be here
and its bringing me out the dark
no you won't
we gotta let go of all of our ghosts
you ain't seen nothing
what if i lose my heart and fail the 
you said i'm crazy
but your not answering the phone
whatever it takes
rolling in the deep
i've changed my mind
but i found a boy who i love more
i'm heading straight for you
i wont stand by you
cause who wants to be right as rain
'cause it will never hurt
my god this reminds me
will he still love me even when hes free
ye that's it honey

i won't say a word
for everything that ive done
with eyes that make you melt

movin to the country
when youre holding me
like i'm the one for you
it's the sweetest
youve burnt my heart to stone
i'll do everything different
i'm willing to take the risk
fire burning and it's lighting me up
i don't want you at all
if you'd just let me in your life
i'll be my own savior
and theres many shades of black
i miss you when the lights go out
to the beat
i can't go back to the river
i cant love you in the dark
hold your breath and count to ten
i wont rise until this battles won
didn't i do it right to let you down
morning will come
and boy she's bringing you down
but i crumble completely when you cry
i'm a red hot mama but i'm blue for you
i won't go i can't do it on my own
a warm embrace
i often think about where i went wrong
feel the earth move & then
make your dreams come true
even if it leads nowhere yeah
will he will he still remember me
'cause you feel like home
but i wont go i cant do it on my own
who wants to be right as rain
oy im tired
it only makes it harder baby
gonna eat me a lot of peaches
i wasnt ready then im ready now
as far as i'm concerned
oh yea a a oh oh oh oh oh
your lips my lips apocalypse
cause we are living worlds apart
we could've had it all
when the rain
why do i hate the idea of being free
i can't help feeling
do tell me why you waste our time
i promise i'm worth it
but good to catch
baby dont let the lights go down
simply its tiring
walking with each other 
i want you
god only knows what we're fighting for
i still care
everything just takes me back
i guess were like water and a flame
i wish youd come over
ovunque vai
this ain't easy it's not meant to be
if you want me to stop i'll freeze
im being cruel to be kind
turn oh no no
hold your breath & count to ten
whichever road i choose youll go
i ain't lost just wandering
i'd go black and blue
for breaking your heart
with every feeling & every word
hoping youre someone i used to know
i wish nothing but the best for you
right here right now
of your loving arms
i get excitement in my bones
i won't forgive me if i gave up trying
i aint lost just wandering
and i'm sure my eyes they speak for me
ill be better for you
but now the sky has cleared & it's blue
god only knows why its taken me
sometimes i wake up by the door
you make me feel like i am whole again
it drags as i lose my mind
for someone like you
i know it aint easy giving up your heart
i'd go crawling
the scars of your love remind me of us
that i will be your remedy
but i want to live
somebody smeared
i wont make the same mistake again
put myself behind a jailhouse door
but we had time against us
plus hes there for you
found myself today singing out your name
go to the ends
i want your heaven and your oceans too
so wipe that dirty smile off
water and a flame
darling this is goodbye
lord have mercy on my soul
brushing past my every groove
heavens cried
even thought everythings a strain
lose yourself in time
reminded by things i find
your body standing over me
when youll just crumble back on down
this is the end
i get closer you obviously prefer her
im the only one in love
if i tell the world
when we spoke yesterday
but if by chance you're here alone
i didnt know quite what to do
im movin on
you made a fool out of you
see if i shed a single sorry tear
so i won't go i can't do it on his own
but if i cant have you
it illuminates all of my doubts
one i never looked for
is there anything i can do for you dear
it's better when something is wrong
that i wouldn't do
that i wouldnt do
for everything that i've done
bring your heart ill bring my soul
in a factory downtown
could have had it all
the crazier i turn into
i dont need your honesty
cause i love
the storms are raging on the rolling sea
i remember you said
i heard that you're settled down
i had no idea of the state we were in
woulda been gone like a wayward wind
i'm happy & unhappy too
favoritism aint my thing but 
i heard his voice today
havent you heard the rumors
so close yet still far away
so i can finish what has begun
if ive been on your mind
im heading straight for you
i promise im worth it
it's no secret
i gotta go
and i swear you moved overseas
yeah there's many shades of black
what you see i see
seems i love the things you do
cause heart break and hearts wait
turn my sorrow into treasured gold
but instead i fall back to my knees
you when you don't yeah yeah
hello from the outside
build your world around me
you're my scope everything everywhere
oh oh oh
but be delicate with my ego
every story has its scars
come out and haunt me i know you want me
and even in the dark
but go on go on take it take it all you
love you
so that's it baby
and bear my soul
and i'm gonna make your head burn
hold me like im more than just a friend
'cause who wants to be right as rain
but i ain't done much healing
it was just like a movie
and tell me no lies
a thousand miles and poles apart
waiting for a surprise
i don't know why i'm scared
yeah that's it honey
just what im hoping for
god only knows why its taken me 
as far as im concerned
everything i do is for you
you make me feel like i am fun again
i wasn't ready then i'm ready now
let it burn
under your thumb i cant breathe
forgive me first love but i'm tired
blew me away
baby i'm calling for you
hello how are you
like a bomb before explosion
theres a fire starting in my heart
that was what you told me
you're gonna wish you never had met me
why do you steal my hand
like im the one for you
dont need to look no further
youll never know if you never try
lo passo mai insieme ate
the more i do the less i know
when he shouldnt be
if it hadn't been for love
what did you expect
couldve had it all
i dont want you at all
you and me together
we've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
ta da da da ta da da da yes i
but ive heard one on you
where i grew up & found my feet
soaking up the sun
when will i see you again
but i would never
say it ain't so say it ain't so
i wont let you close enough to hurt me
i cant help feeling
and i ain't asking for forgiveness
you & me together nothing gets better
but baby is that really what you want
hoping youll walk through
and a million miles
youre the wiser one disguised from greed
a girl like you ain't meant to go away
i promise you will see
i wouldn't be wishing i was free
sure she's got it all
thats not fair
but like everything i've ever known
give me a memory i can use
if you're ready i am ready
stop and wait a sec
ive forgiven it all
oh i'm movin' on
that's it
some say i'll be better without you
when you don't yeah
and i see my future in you
shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
your love it is my truth
ticking by your call
but nothing will never taint us
to dry your tears
didnt i do it right
when night comes and i'm all on my own
i love the way your body moves
though winds of change
i'll never say enough
i will always love you
never woulda loaded up a forty four
and lay yourself down
look don't get me wrong
so thats it baby
i guess i still care
maybe i should leave to help you see
don't try to change my mind
did you ever make it out of that town
all of my life
she she aint real
i was running you were walking
everybody taking different sides
you know ill always mean
baby im so rising
so that's it
and everything you do's a game
the one that shoots me each & every time
boy im tired of trying
tell me to run & i'll race
i will leave my heart at the door
everybody sees
you ain't seen nothing like me yet
'cause then i don't see
you know how the time flies
if only if only you knew 
they've all been said before you know
plus he's there for you
im tired of trying
ill be waiting
but i've heard one on you
however far away i will always love you
and have you tell me
so thats it
he won't go
youre the right kind of madness
and fall
but we do but we do but we do
cause theres many shades of black
turn down these voices
you dont seem
let me fall into your gravity
but its you who makes me lose my head
you think we would and we do 
who want to be right as rain
and i i i i i dont think you can save me
maybe were already defeated
but we couldnt see eye to eye
when it fell something died
there is no simple
when i was young
like a joke or a memory
i'd eat peaches every day
cause when hard work don't pay off
go to the ends of this earth for you
we wont be making up
oh i hold you for a million years
and fly around in circles
that tears down my walls
i miss the air i miss my friends
sun soakin bulges in the shade
im a red hot mama but you white and cold
that's what you said when you left me
but my knees were far too weak
you sound like a song
like he's never felt a figure before
our hearts break and hearts wait
don't patronize
cause ive been by myself all night long
oh honey if im not the one for you
for you and i together here
'cause i've been here before
theres never been a better time
is everything really meant to change
i should have known
you get the people & the government
even though everything's a strain
you told me you were ready
the love you don't feel
woke up feeling heavy hearted
if you want me to stop ill freeze
she made your heart melt
you will only be eternally
but like everything ive ever known
your teasing ain't enough
and hope that you find the missing piece
we were sad of getting old
'cause there's a side to you
our hearts break & hearts wait
here in the dark in these final hours
just cause you heard it
when the rain is blowing in your face
and leave me
no one has me like you do baby
sitting on the sea
i know im not the only one
didnt i do it right did i let you down
rumor has it ooh
you give up everything you are
i want your heaven and your ocean's too
i wont go i cant do it on my own
'cause i knew that that was 
these days when i see you
all that i have is on the floor
stop & wait a sec
and you played it to the beat
round my hometown
god only knows why it's taken me
i will be i will be
i feel my heart begin to burst & bleed
haven't you heard the rumors
oy i'm tired
all of my life ive been frozen
life was a party to be thrown
for the big one for the big jump
you made me leave you
youre gonna wish you never had met me
but sometimes it hurts instead
ooh the people ive met yea
but you played it you played it
without the security
se non ci fossi tu
and make me crazy for you
and all i can do is watch & cry
and you played it
and the stars appear
we were both right
i feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
cause i love you
i can't help myself from looking for you
when night comes and im on my own
i'm movin' on
oh they smeared it
than you ever did me before
i fall short each time
under haunted skies i see you ooh
you played it you played it
baby i can take a lot
think we'll never match at all
cause it was not said to you
turning oh
you can say i chose to be alone
down down down down
come on & give me the chance
ill be home soon i wont be late
turn down these voices inside my head
i had hoped youd see my face
but i will never do you wrong
to give up this fight
id settle for a busy tone
there is so much space between us
guess she gave you things
standing there
if i had my little way
ill never say enough
so i wont go i cant do it on his own
when it crumbles
don't patronize me
the way i'm running with you honey
no doubt in my mind
my life had no color before i met you
hold me like i'm more than just a friend
which forgive you each time
of my world
i'd go hungry i'd go black and blue
she she ain't real
or at least as far as i thought i knew
or a place that you can hide
that's not fair
aint like you to hold back
if this aint love then what is
every word i've said
with your loving there aint nothing
so overdue i owe them
watched it pour as i touched your face
but you won't no you won't
all of my life i've been frozen
only yesterday was the time of our lives
it turns out it aint enough
this would taste
and id go crawling down the avenue
on the rolling sea
i heard that youre settled down
when night comes & your all on your own
oh id do anything
can't say that it's been that great
who regrets the things theyve done
like hes never felt a figure before
tell me who do i run to
i cant do it on my own
and have you tell me 
where love is lost your ghost is found
our love aint water under the bridge
with a beating
'cause when hard work don't pay off
and i aint asking for forgiveness
that terrific rainbow over you and me
she is half your age
forgive me first love but im too tired
cause there's many shades of black
when the night keeps you from sleeping
your gonna wish you never had met me
i thought you loved me more than this
yes i swam dirty waters
making memories using my eyes
she is a stranger
'cause i love you
with you and me setting the tone
i realized what i wanted wasn't there
you make me feel like i am home again
i cant keep up with your turning tables
with you & me setting the tone
no i won't rescue you to just desert me
so stand beside the river i cried
there's nothing else i want
when night comes & you're on your own
just look & you will see
shows that we aint gonna stand shit
but it dont matter it clearly
or would it be a waste
i'd settle for a busy tone
youre the only one that i want
do you hang on every word i say
there's no way i
now im resemblance to the man i met
their lipstick
and turn me into a crumbling fool
i wont ask you you to just desert me
oh i'm so mad i'm getting old
our love ain't water under the bridge
when you dont yeah
when we were young
you know how to feel things
we were the greatest me & you
until you kissed my lips & you saved me
yours too baby come on now
harder baby harder baby harder baby
cause i found a boy who i love more
i can't love you in the dark
all my life
don't let go baby give me light
are the wonders of this world
to earn my stripes id have to pay
and be thankful when it's done
i get excitement in your bones
or scared of having nothing left
i'm trying to be brave
you should know i chose to be alone
yeah theres any shades of black
i wish nothing but the best
in the light of day
before i go
yeah yeah that's it honey
i hoped youd see my face
its been nearly an hour
i didn't know a single word he said
my heart so bad it cuts through
and making up the past
now that its over
even if it leads nowhere
under haunted skies i see you
closer & near
you hang on every word i say
and though your hair
you said im stubborn and i never give in
you make me feel like i am free again
don't forget me i begged
to tell you i'm sorry
so why dont we just play pretend
that we met
that you and i are wrong
and boy shes bringing you down
euna vita che cercando a te
if this ain't love then what is
did i let you down
if your worry bound
where it felt something die
is the answer to it all
you're my light you're my darkness
so come on & give me the chance
every feeling every word
closer and near
you're like a dream come true
i've seen your face under every sky
they melt my heart to stone
could've had it all
cause i knew that that was 
baby i'm so rising
i heard youve been missing me
'cause he won't go
and watched you wave
i could make you happy
but youre cold to the core
so i can start to begin whats begun
i'd build myself up
natures candy in my hand or can or a pie
if i am i'm crazy for you
and you showed up
walking with each other
this aint easy its not meant to be
cause then i dont see
were willing to take the risk
on this endless game
i promise i'm worthy mm
its better when something is wrong
you build me up then leave me dead
what have i done
ive been here before
just a vague & broken boy instead
every time he aint here
they cant look me in the eye
missing out the cracks in the pavement
when the evening shadows
the sweetest devotion i've known
i aint yours for no taking
fool that i am
maybe youll see
or i did last time i checked
so long to let my doubts go
i promise im worthy 
but i won't go i can't do it on my own
ooh aah oh
never woulda seen the trouble that im in
i need to get away to feel again
but you'd save the best for last
never mind ill find someone like you
i promise i'm worth it mm
so why don't we just play pretend
tell me to run and i'll race
i'd go hungry
you & i have history
its so cold in your wilderness
baby don't let the lights go down
next time i'll be braver
it was in the darkest of my days
whenever you look at me i wish i was her
where worlds collide and days are dark
baby i quit
to make you feel my love
welcome sunrise with the morning glory
but youll never have my heart
there is something in your loving
the way im running with you honey
its so cold out here in your wilderness
but when i call you never
inside my head
you make me feel like i am young again
cause i knew that that was
don't come any closer
you set me free oh
and a part of me keeps holding on
ill be somebody different
please forgive me for my sins
id go crawling
put your hand in my hand
hello from the outside outside
ive imagined it all
this ain't lust
if you'd consider what we shared
take it as it comes
waiting as my heart drops
thats why i cant love you in the dark
and i'll do what's right
that i will be i will be i will be
you said im crazy
i beg ill remember you say
that this would be inevitable
cause i heard it screaming out your name
whichever road i choose you'll go
didnt i do it right to let you down
you drift into my head
pacing floors & opening doors
and i will always love you
thats it
there's so many ways to act
something that it wont
all the things youd say
you made a fool out of me
and ignore the right
and im sure my eyes they speak for me
nothing that i wouldnt do
if youre ready i am ready
i know you havent made your mind up yet
it turns out it ain't enough
but go on & take it take it all to you
i will change if i must
i wanna step into your great unknown
i'll be waiting
ooh the people i've met
now you're gone
throw your soul through every open door
cause mine sure wont be shared
if i am im crazy for you
i didnt give to you
but as time goes on & my age gets older
we both know we aint kids no more
i could hold you for a million years
and he could change the world
youre still not mentioning love
there's only one way down
say what's on your mind
there's nothing that i wouldn't do
then our eyes cry & souls sigh
you're the only one that i want
you make me feel like i am clean again
if you got someone else
and well stand
fire burning and its lighting me up
theres never been a better place
maybe we're already defeated
ill do everything different
where worlds collide & days are dark
but despite the truth that i know
well it burned while i cried
so is it over
but i wont go
it's been there for days on end and
favoritism ain't my thing but 
to scratch my itch & beat my drum
theyve all been said before you know
they can't look me in the eye
theres so many ways to act
to make us grow from dust
he cant do it on his own
no theres nothing that i wouldnt do
i dont know why im scared
i've been searching
when the pain cuts you deep
you set me free
it's so cold in your wilderness
when we were younger and free
are the wonders of now
gonna eat a lot of peaches
when i found a boy who loves me more
dont pretend that you dont want me
strips me down bare
i thought i told you hed be home soon
nobody told me that you'd be here
e'una vita che cercando a te
im a red hot mama but im blue for you
but i aint done much healing
i grow fonder every day
to earn my stripes i'd have to pay
like me yet
that i will be i will be your remedy
that the both of us
when night comes & i'm on my own
baby please remember me once more
you made me tumble
if you're ready if you're ready
he's willing to take the risk
if this is aint love then what is
hear my heart burst again
baby im calling for you
i find it funny that youre the only
with every feeling and every word
was all in place
millions of peaches peaches for free
god only knows what were fighting for
who would have known how bittersweet
at skyfall
and all i can do is watch and cry
we were born and raised in a summer haze
close enough to start a war
you had my heart inside of your hands
no and thank you please madam
we were born & raised
i know this is love but
crazy for you
i'd always kiss
i wont forgive me if i gave up trying
if youre ready if youre ready
to tell you im sorry
mornin' will come & i'll do what's right
just the guitar
let me stay here for just one more night
when the thunder calls for me
lay down with me tell me no lies
stop asking me to stay
it's like they're scared of me
oooohhhh
this love has dried up and stayed behind
per me il mondo finira
but he stays all the same
i could hold you
could it be the brightest star
with the world that you feel leave
then choke on words i'd always hide
until the end starts
i guess she gave you things
cause i knew that that was the last time
you made me want you
the last time the last time
and its been that way to long
so watch them turn to dust
turn down the bed
you aint seen nothing like me yet
he is a real lover
four cold walls without parole
but theres a side to you
go ahead and still my heart
haven't made
ye that's it baby
you look like a movie
and neon lights and waiting papers
when you dont ooh dont
didn't i give it all
to forget your past & simply be mine
and that's exactly what i need to do
ive been looking for you baby
cause what if i never love again
or don't you remember
youve been on my mind
and i'm forever excusing your intentions
but at least when youre at your worst
what ill say is
send my love to your new lover
all that i say you always say more
for you too don't forget me
regrets & mistakes their memories made
they don't know you like i do
put a kiss on top of your head
i call that home
everybody here is watching you
i never woulda hitch hiked to birmingham
no i won't ask you you to just desert me
to hold in your arms
i wish you'd come over
just take it all with my love
my dignity is become undone
but that was a million years ago
when you don't
just take it take it all with you
see when hard work don't pay off
so come on and give me the chance
where'd you go when you stayed behind
say that its always been me
painting pictures
couldnt stay away i couldnt fight it
you had my heart inside your hand
when you'll just crumble back on down
it feels like we're oceans apart
i feel like my life is flashing by
they were never true never true
it was just like a song
watch you wave
so stand beside the river you cried
dont come any closer
you couldve had it all
and on the highway of regret
i'm tired of this empty house
so i can start to begin what's begun
memories are fresh
skyfall is where we start
i've never known this never before
an you showed up
when i don't get nothing back
say whats on your mind
but now i give up
regrets & mistakes they're memories made
though i do know how you play
i find it funny that you're the only
of the earth for you
standing on my own two feet
i've made up my mind
i'll be home soon i won't be late
that i never knew never knew
because i'm too crazy for you
ill be better to you
he said to hold my breath to sit & wait
and dreamed about you woman
i know i'm not the only one
they dont know you like i do
we couldve had it all
i'll be somebody different
there's so many shades of black
at least i know he's lying still
ive known it
see how i leave with every piece of you
i was so scared to face my fears
i didn't give to you
its calling me home its calling me home
someone else
just what i'm hoping for
its been waiting for you to open up
but you wont
you aint seen nothing
and turning my heel & strutting my feet
you could've had it all
over every border & on every line
ain't like you to hold back
but the more i do
and kiss me back to life to see
hitting me like an explosion
never woulda hitch hiked to birmingham
i've been here before
ive drowned & dreamt this moment
im okay im okay yes i am
theres only one way down
i need a drink to get me out
'cause heart break & hearts wait
but if by chance youre here alone
and it's teasing me
under your thumb i can't breathe
i let it fall my heart
of our glory days
pacing floors and opening doors
think we'll never match at all but we do
its harder when youre on top
where nothing ever happened
they were put there by a man
theres so many shades of black
tell a story that i cannot bear to hear
i'll put my hands up
and no one had blame
cause i cant make you love me
i want to feel my heartbeat so
and i'd go crawling down the avenue
its been there for days on end and
we've both know we ain't kids no more
painting pictures with my mind
all i ask is
i beg ill remember you said
take your eyes off of me so i can leave
i was too strong you were trembling
if you need a friend or a lover
just look and you will see
and i threw us into the flames
cant have you the way
and now i've had enough of love
and i hear your words that i made up
and boy youre bringing me down
we were born & raised in a summer haze
just take it take it all to you
making a home down there
yes i do and always loved you
you say ive known you longer my dear
no we aint kids no more
nothing compares no worries or cares
without one dollar to my name
so who want to be right as rain
i quit im movin on
i'd go crawling down the avenue
if you're not the one for me
it made us restless
i will lay down my heart
youre so provocative im so conservative
you get the people and the government
we could have had it all
but at least when your at your worst
yeah thats it honey
your mind up yet
a jaw dropper
than i ever did you before
in every face that ive ever known
'cause i love
even thought everything's a strain
before we realized
we won't be making up
i've known it
for a million years
couldn't stay away i couldn't fight it
but you pushed me in
even in the daylight when you think that
the morning rain the morning rain
i wish nothing but the best for you too
didn't i do it right did i let you down
i won't ask you you to just desert me
we almost fall apart & burn up easy
to stand in your arms
i guess we're like water & a flame
maybe you'll see
trust me ive learned it
hearts break & hearts wait
or should i just keep chasing pavements
to forget your past and simply be mine
you say i've known you longer my dear
oh if only if only you knew
id go crawling down the avenue
let it burn 
you think we would and we do
and there is no one there
mornin will come and ill do whats right
i know you haven't made your mind up yet
it's been nearly an hour
in every face that i've ever known
we will stand tall
when i lay with you
i can take a lot
and ill do whats right
so hello from the other side other side
when you don't ooh don't
with your loving there ain't nothing
looks like i was wrong
to whisper will you leave your man 
so come on and give me a chance
nei sogni tu con me
cause you feel like home
im tired of this empty house
the things i had planned
and the games you play
i thought i told you he'd be home soon
or dont you remember
doesn't tear you apart anymore
and you're my hope you're my despair
so darling
soltanto una notte ancor
there's never been a better place
at least that i'd know that you're okay
whenever im standing my own ground
favoritism aint my thing but
with every feeling every word
its hard to admit that
chiamami amor
but it's in my roots it's in my veins
where you go i go
nobodys perfect
cant say that its been that great
you and i have history
you would always win always win
dont you know ive fallen for you
and there's many shades of black
look dont get me wrong
but there's a side to you
yes i do & always loved you
alone and face to face
come out and haunt me
who wants to be riding high
and be thankful when its done
it's harder when your on top
even now when were already over
don't need to look no further
ye thats it honey
from the way you talk
i promise im worthy mm
just thinking of your face
i wouldnt be wishing i was free
from all my tears
let this be the way we remember us
hoping you'll walk through
i really thought the pain would pass
without me knowing
i could offer you a warm embrace
are running out of time
and who are you hiding from
dont try to change my mind
hello its me
of when we were young
see if i cry
baby i quit now
i dont wanna be cruel or vicious
you've burnt my heart to stone
and my back begins to tingle
he would be hard to chase
you think we would & we do
can i have a moment
but we do but we do but we do but we do
then our eyes cry and souls sigh
i've forgiven it all
it's hard to admit that
nothing that i wouldn't do
devotion
i've imagined it all
i ain't yours for no taking
sometimes i just feel its only me
he will choose the poison over me
when night comes & i'm all on my own
i'll close my eyes then i won't see
why dont you remember dont you remember
and neon lights & waiting papers
il tempo passa senza che
if you've got someone else
still how can you walk away
just in case it hasnt gone
no i wont ask you you to just desert me
when we used
you're all that i need
'cause we had time against us
are throwing wild & free
and the games youd play
just 'cause you heard it
and its teasing me
fire burning & it's lighting me up
feel you here forever
dont patronize me
i quit now
at least i can say that i've tried
take it all with my love
i can't do it on my own
to the way you move
and if i'm not the one for you
cause theres a side to you
now i'm resemblance to the man i met
when we were younger & free
to when you were there
e non importa che io senta per te
youre like a dream come true
all this sorrow and this pain
whenever i'm standing my own ground
pulls me down turns me weak for you
havent made
but you wont no you wont
i set fire to the rain
is there anyone i could call
swept away im stolen
i will always be there
so where you been then don't go all coy
a girl like you aint meant to go away
some say ill be better without you
towards me from across the room
were not the only ones
tried my best
think well never match at all
see when hard work dont pay off
just hold me closly
we were born and raised
i don't regret a thing
ive never known this never before
if it hadnt been for love
so if you got
but youd save the best for last
i won't stand by you
i dont see you
oh honey if i'm not the one for you
i had hoped you'd see my face
since i thought of you
sometimes the hole you left hurts
no we ain't kids no more
i want every single piece of you
but it's you who makes me lose my head
if youd just let me in your life
tell me to run and ill race
im giving you up
i dont regret a thing
just give me till then
where you belong
id build myself up
it was dark & i was over
i didnt know a single word he said
if youre not the one for me
is exactly what it seems
lay down with me
oh anymore
even though everythings a strain
when the day is done
yeah there's any shades of black
i'm trying to tell you just how
i let my heart decide the way
id eat peaches every day
seem to be home
it's already in your eyes
just hold me close dont patronize
no one knows me like you do
so that we know that it hurts
we had a date
but sometimes it hurts instead yeah
treat me soft but touch me cool
no doubt in my mind where you belong
my hands they're strong
im trying to be brave
i know there is no tomorrow
oh i'd do anything
and though i wish that you were here
all of these words whispered in my ear
oh oh no
i'll be better for you
oh im movin on
if you dont
it's so cold out here in your wilderness
time against us
or hide from the light
the night
daydreamer
shows that we aint gonna take it
yeah theres many shades of black
if i'm in love with you
could describe him
the storms are raging
all this sorrow & this pain
for this is the end
i'm the only one in love
when i walk around all of the streets
when i dont get nothing back
ive drowned and dreamt this moment
you're the only one that i wanted
dont look back at this crumbling fool
yeah yeah thats it honey
come out & haunt me i know you want me
ill put my hands up
and not just survive
what are you waiting for
and hold you tight
we were the greatest me and you
if i'm wrong i am right
there's never been a better time
cause it will never hurt
but we do doo doo doo doo doo ah oh
i heard you've been missing me
weve gotta let go of all of our ghosts
four cold walls against my will
sooth me so
i won't let you close enough to hurt me
next time ill be braver
but you're cold to the core
and put myself behind a jailhouse door
you disappear one day
i hear your words you made up
im going back to 505
dont let go baby give me light
deep down i must have always known
in this situation i'll be glad
baby i have no story to be told
out im still trying to stay inside
that i give in to my pretendings
i cant bear this time
you can't make your heart feel
cause when hard work dont pay off
learning to fly learning to run
movin' to the country
everything you got
i promise i'm worthy
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
i'm tired of trying
come on & give me a chance
this love has dried up & stayed behind
this is how the story went
whenever im alone with you
but you played it with a beating
and everything you dos a game
and as it fell you rose to claim it
then choke on words id always hide
hello from the other side other side
it only makes it harder baby harder baby
you'll never know if you never try
and boy you're bringing me down
finally could this be it or
ive cried my heart out
you're the right kind of madness
i don't need your honesty
i poked my finger down inside
but it don't matter it clearly
i'll be better to you
it's in my roots it's in my veins
of my world yeah
when night comes and i'm on my own
i won't rise until this battle's won
you and your charm creep closer
but you won't
so i can show you that i was wrong
sun soakin' bulges in the shade
when night comes and youre on your own
you close the door
no room in my bed
doo yeah yea a a oh oh oh oh oh ooh
excuse me first love but were through
when you're holding me
i kept my distance so you would be free
and youre my hope youre my despair
from the moment
but we do doo doo doo but we do
the sweetest devotion
look out
that i can't adore
it's been waiting for you to open up
go ahead & still my heart
and thats exactly what i need to do
to make me cry again
i wish i could lay down beside you
dont forget me i begged
i can't keep up with your turning tables
when he shouldn't be
seven days has gone so fast
it's harder when you're on top
i'm going back to where i started
at least that id know that youre okay
but its in my roots its in my veins
you think we would & we do 
trust me i've learned it
the sweetest devotion ive known
didn't i do it right
never mind i'll find someone like you
i didn't know quite what to do
that terrific rainbow over you & me
peaches come from a can
he wont go
out i'm still trying to stay inside
if you see me coming
they make believe that everything
alone & face to face
im trying to tell you just how
we both know we ain't kids no more
hes willing to take the risk
sometimes i just feel it's only me
i only wanted to have fun
a thousand miles & poles apart
when you dont
i won't make the same mistake again
i'm a red hot mama but you white & cold
please stay where you are
i'd go hungry i'd go black & blue
i miss my mother i miss it when
the only thing that i want is your love
when night comes and im all on my own
ye thats it baby
you played it to the beat
dropped you off at the train station
but i won't go
because im too crazy for you
so where you been then dont go all coy
turning tables
got the music in you baby tell me why
we're not the only ones
i hope that youre well
but go on and take it take it all to you
i want you to be my keeper
but if i
you & your charm creep closer
it matters how this ends
'cause what if i never love again
at least i can say that ive tried
when was the last time you thought of me
dont patronize
i cant help myself from looking for you
if this is my last night with you
are throwing wild and free
but now the sky has cleared and its blue
for you & i together here
don't you know i've fallen for you
treat her better
come on and give me the chance
at the mention of my name
ill close my eyes then i wont see
whered you go when you stayed behind
old friend why are you so shy
i'll close my eyes
and gets me into my favorite mood
what i'll say is
every now & then my memories ache
when we were both right
we almost fall apart and burn up easy
to make you feel my love oh yes
shows that we are united
in case it is the last time
if i've been on your mind
don't forget me i beg
i forgive you once again
who regrets the things they've done
and im forever excusing your intentions
should i give up
regrets and mistakes their memories made
and i will give up this fight
and if im not the one for you
ill close my eyes
i'm happy and unhappy too
i beg i'll remember you say
as much as it did then
theres nothing that i wouldnt do
come out & haunt me
no final kiss to seal anything
my hands theyre strong
bring your heart i'll bring my soul
excuse me first love but we're through
youre all that i need
with your hands between your thighs
favoritism ain't my thing but
just for you
if im in love with you
a million years ago
that i will be i will be your remedy oh
don't pretend that you don't want me
these final hours
nobody's perfect
then sees you through
think well never match at all but we do
make a little room for an ant to hide
i say we've only known each other a year
each & every time i turn around to leave
it makes me reckless
youre my scope everything everywhere
that i call home
turns me crazy
voglio che sai
pull me in hold me tight
is the subject of their talk
i never woulda loaded up a forty four
if youd consider what we shared
please don't fall apart
waits for you
you shower me with words made of knives
you know i know just how you feel
say it aint so say it aint so
ma ti pensavo sempre
when the world seems so cruel
hello can you hear me
ive seen your face under every sky
i could offer you
dont need to think it over
filling up my heart with golden stories
i'd go black & blue
it all it all it all
hoping you're someone i used to know
let the sky fall
squished a rotten peach in my fist
to bring you back to me
i braved a hundred storms to leave you
i beg i'll remember you said
but they don't recognize me now
it feels like were oceans apart
i thought of me i want to see
bound by the surprise of our glory days
in a summer haze bound by the surprise
every time he ain't here
i want your heaven & your ocean's too
if im wrong i am right
oh im so mad im getting old
youre my light youre my darkness
you know i'll always mean
theres nothing else i want
but we couldn't see eye to eye
i'm giving you up
hold me closer one more time
this aint lust
i guess we're like water and a flame
i try to think of things to say
over every border and on every line
i can't face your breaking heart
'cause heart break and hearts wait
im going back to where i started
and for what & for what & for what
and miles between us
god only knows why it's taken me 
your name
sometimes it lasts in love
when night comes and you're on your own
and the more i do the less i know
a couple more til i forget your name
you still sound like a song
i cant face your breaking heart
theres such a difference between us
where i grew up and found my feet
ive been searching
i realized what i wanted wasnt there
and the whole world
i hoped you'd see my face
its the sweetest
'cause mine sure won't be shared
but dont you remember dont you remember
it is the world to me
its in my roots its in my veins
looks good when he walks
weve both know we aint kids no more
never woulda gone to that side of town
you can find him sittin on your doorstep
do you wrong
i know id never be me
go ahead
now youre gone
oh that you know
well it felt something died
and if i stay i'll be alive
its no secret
there's such a difference between us
i'm okay i'm okay yes i am
id go hungry id go black and blue
i say weve only known each other a year
don't need to think it over
then i went on home to my skyscrapers
ive known it from the moment that we met
you said i'm stubborn & i never give in
hello it's me
i must've called a thousand times
face it all together
thats what you said when you left me
turned my sorrow into treasured gold
but i set fire to the rain
people say crazy things
cause we had time against us
and now ive had enough of love
you cant make your heart feel
i don't wanna be cruel or vicious
i look away i look away
id go hungry
the other night
go ahead & still it's not steal my heart
ooh the people ive met
don't look back at this crumbling fool
down the avenue
let it out let it all out
its like theyre scared of me
if you don't
forgive me first love but im tired
i promise im worth it mm
even though my hands are tied
im happy and unhappy too
miles between us
lights go down lights go down
ill be my own savior
dont forget me i beg
every now and then my memories ache
he can't do it on his own
now that it's over
for you too dont forget me
send me spinning closer to you
i look away i will look away
you take it all with my love
when i fell off your mind
i could stay there
or will he go back to the place where
something that it won't
you make it look like i'm see through
i know you
let me photograph you in this light
i mustve called a thousand times
and everyone agrees
i miss you i miss you
at least i know hes lying still
i'm going back to 505
do you still care
i will feel the power
ive made up my mind
no & thank you please madam
'cause i can't make you love me
as you tear your way right through me
i'm being cruel to be kind
ya da hey hey hey hey
not shy of a spark
you get excitement in your bones
oh honey
ive changed my mind
just hold me close don't patronize
i saw a boy that looked like you
that finally feels like home
you when you dont yeah yeah
if youve got someone else
i quit i'm movin' on
and even then you don't get far
let this be our lesson in love
i wish i could live a little more
you had my heart inside of your hand
close my eyes
just a vague and broken boy instead
two hours late
so little to say but so much time
you're still not mentioning love
its already in your eyes
i heard that your dreams came true
come on and give me a chance
and for what and for what and for what
forgive me first love but i'm too tired
that you & i are wrong
id always kiss
i promise i'm worthy 
hold my hand while you cut me down
im willing to take the risk
reaching a fever pitch
i promise im worthy
you make it look like im see through
and even then you dont get far
and save me boy
but at least when you're at your worst
see i can see that look in your eyes
the heavens cried
i can't bear this time
to turning tables
didnt i give it all
i wont say a word
shows that we ain't gonna take it
i know deep down inside
can't have you the way
to say goodnight
even now when we're already over
finally i can see you crystal clear
doesnt tear you apart anymore
you say boo ive known you longer my dear
you must be mistaken
that i cant adore
running riots inside my soul
take my hands off of your eyes too soon
boy i'm tired of trying
simply it's tiring
the love you dont feel
but go on & take it take it all with you
the one that i belong to
and the games you'd play
turn down the lights
keeping me from harm
every place
millions of peaches peaches for me
and im gonna make your head burn
nothing is better
and if i stay ill be alive
cause ive been here before
you and me together nothing gets better
'cause we are living worlds apart
you played it
and if your mind is made up
and the whole world is on your case
i've been looking for you baby
you know my heart more than i do
you & me together
what if i lose my heart & fail the 
every word ive said
no there's nothing that i wouldn't do
fed up of biding your time
so i can tell you that i was wrong
lose myself in time
you say its all in my head
i met someone by accident
please dont fall apart
we play so dirty in the dark
whenever i'm alone with you
your remedy mmm hmm mmm hmm
feel the earth move and then
with his hands behind his back oh
that's why i can't love you in the dark
i don't see you
go on go on & take it take it all to you
there's a fire starting in my heart
they say that times supposed to heal ya
wake me up wake me up when all is done
but lately
in hope that you find the missing piece
but we do
nobody knows it better than me
but not if you are so reckless
you don't seem
and it's been that way to long
your teasing aint enough
you better pull me to the light
you grace me with your cold shoulder
on your face
the last time
theres no way i
this was all you none of it me
that you are in my life
hearts break and hearts wait
just in case it hasn't gone
cause he wont go
the way i want you
its harder when your on top
youre the only one that i wanted
bursting at the seams no doubt
but you played it
i know some clothes you left behind
but they dont recognize me now
i hope that you're well
